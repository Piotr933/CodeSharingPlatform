# Code Sharing Platform

This project was developed as part of the Java Backend Developer track from JetBrains Academy. It showcases my skills in backend development while also providing exposure to frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The primary focus of the project was to create a secure code sharing platform.

By incorporating HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in the project, I have gained practical experience in frontend development, will allow me to understand and collaborate more effectively with frontend developers.
